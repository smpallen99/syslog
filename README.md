Syslog
======

Syslog is an Elixir port of the erlang [Twig](https://github.com/cloudant/twig) 
logger. It is an Elixir logger backend providing UDP support to a syslog server.

## Configuration

### Elixir Project

Syslog's behavior is controlled using the application configuration environment:

* __host__ (127.0.0.1): the hostname of the syslog server
* __port__ (514): the port of the syslog server
* __facility__ (:local2): syslog facility to be used
* __level__ (:info): logging threshold. Messages "above" this threshold (in syslog parlance) will be discarded. Acceptable values are debug, info, notice, warn, err, crit, alert, and emerg.
* __appid__ (:elixir): inserted as the APPID in the syslog message

For example, the following `config/config.exs` file sets up syslog using 
level debug, facility local2, and appid myproj

```
use Mix.Config
config :logger, [
  level: :debug,
  backends: [Logger.Backends.Syslog],
  syslog: [facility: :local1, appid: "myproj"]
]
```

### Add the application

You should also add the `syslog` application in the `mix.exs` file as shown below:

```
defmodule MyMod.Mixfile do
  # ...
  def application do
    [applications: [:logger, :syslog],
     mod: {MyMod, []}]
  end
  # ...
end
```

### Syslog Server

The syslog server must be configured to support remote logging. On a Redhat based 
Linux distribution, you can setup remote logging by editing `/etc/sysconfig/syslog`
and add the -r option as shown below:

```
# /etc/sysconfig/syslog
...
SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="-m 0 -r"
...
```

If your system uses `rsyslog` you should add or uncomment the following lines in your `/etc/rsyslog.conf`:
```
$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514
```

The facility also needs to be configured. Again, for Redhat distributions, edit 
`/etc/syslog.conf`, edit the first line below and and add the second:

```
#/etc/syslog.conf
...
*.info;local1.none;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none            /var/log/messages
...
local2.*                    /var/log/my_elixir_project.log
```

Then restart the `syslog` service after making the configuration changes

```
root@ucx20 ~]# service syslog restart
Shutting down kernel logger:                               [  OK  ]
Shutting down system logger:                               [  OK  ]
Starting system logger:                                    [  OK  ]
Starting kernel logger:                                    [  OK  ]
[root@ucx20 ~]#
```
